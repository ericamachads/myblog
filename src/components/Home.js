      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
        I was born in a small town in the countryside of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and I have the honor of being the first in my family to attend university. My academic journey led me to major in Mathematics at the prestigious Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). During my undergraduate studies, I had the remarkable opportunity to participate in a transformative exchange program sponsored by Brazil at the University of Évora in Portugal.

        <p>
        Based on this solid foundation, I graduated with honors in 2020 and achieved the distinction of obtaining a double degree. Continuing my educational pursuit, I embarked on a master's program in Mathematics Education, which I successfully completed in 2023. 
        </p>
        <p>
        My academic journey in Brazil and Portugal initially led me to programming, but my heart was captivated by the thrilling realm of front-end development, a passion I delve deeper into on the "About" page.
        </p>
        <p>
        This journey has shaped me into a diligent, dedicated, and resilient individual, ready to tackle challenges and constantly seek improvement in my career and in life. I am thrilled to share my passion for programming and my teaching experience with the world as I continue to explore new horizons in web development.
